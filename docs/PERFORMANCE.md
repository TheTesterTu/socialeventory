# Performance Optimization Guide

## Current Optimizations

### List Virtualization
We use `react-window` for efficiently rendering large lists of events. This significantly improves performance by only rendering items that are currently visible in the viewport.

### Image Loading
- Lazy loading for images
- Proper sizing and compression
- Next-gen image formats

### Data Management
- Efficient caching with React Query
- Optimistic updates
- Debounced search operations

### Map Optimizations
- Marker clustering
- Viewport-based data loading
- Efficient re-renders

## Monitoring

### Key Metrics
- First Contentful Paint (FCP)
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
- Time to Interactive (TTI)
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)

### Tools
- Chrome DevTools
- Lighthouse
- Web Vitals
- Custom performance monitoring

## Best Practices

### Component Level
- Use React.memo for expensive renders
- Implement proper key props
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders
- Use proper event handlers

### Data Level
- Implement proper caching
- Use pagination/infinite scroll
- Optimize API responses
- Use proper indexing

### Asset Level
- Optimize images and media
- Use proper CDN
- Implement caching strategies
- Minimize bundle size

## Future Improvements
- [ ] Implement code splitting
- [ ] Add service worker for offline support
- [ ] Optimize third-party scripts
- [ ] Implement proper error boundaries
