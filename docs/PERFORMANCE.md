# Performance Optimization Guide

## Current Optimizations

### List Virtualization
We use `react-window` for efficiently rendering large lists of events. This significantly improves performance by only rendering items that are currently visible in the viewport.

Implementation details:
- `VirtualizedEventList` component handles rendering of large event lists
- Dynamic height calculation based on content
- Optimized animations work with the virtualized list
- Proper cleanup and memory management

### Image Loading
- Lazy loading for images
- Proper sizing and compression
- Next-gen image formats
- Responsive image loading based on device

### Data Management
- Efficient caching with React Query
- Optimistic updates
- Debounced search operations
- Progressive loading of event details

### Map Optimizations
- Marker clustering for dense areas
- Viewport-based data loading
- Efficient re-renders with memoization
- Custom map style optimized for performance

## Monitoring

### Key Metrics
- First Contentful Paint (FCP): < 1.2s target
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): < 2.5s target 
- Time to Interactive (TTI): < 3.5s target
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): < 0.1 target
- First Input Delay (FID): < 100ms target

### Tools
- Chrome DevTools Lighthouse
- Web Vitals monitoring
- Custom performance hooks
- Sentry performance monitoring (free tier)

## Best Practices

### Component Level
- Use React.memo for expensive renders
- Implement proper key props
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders
- Use proper event handlers with cleanup

### Data Level
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Use pagination/infinite scroll with virtualization
- Optimize API responses with field selection
- Use proper indexing on database queries

### Asset Level
- Optimize images with WebP/AVIF formats
- Use CDN for static assets (Cloudflare free tier)
- Implement proper caching headers
- Minimize bundle size with code splitting

## Future Improvements
- [x] Implement list virtualization
- [ ] Add service worker for offline support
- [ ] Implement code splitting for route-based chunks
- [ ] Optimize third-party scripts with lazy loading
- [ ] Implement proper error boundaries and fallbacks
